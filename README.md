# DailyMap
By giving the system the address or GPS coordinates, users will receive the neighborhood information of the spot they are searching to. 
The information that the system provides covers three aspects: point, line and plane. The following describes detail of these three aspects.

*Points: In this section, the system displays the spots in the neighborhood which are public and matters to peopleâ€™s living quality. Such as hospitals, schools, department stores, super markets, convenient stores, parks, post offices and so on.

*Lines: Public transport always be the most-concern thing especially in the urban area. Therefore, the system shows the nearest public stations of high speed rail, railway, and metro and will also tell how far to reach to the searching spot. Also consider that how frequently earthquakes occur in Taiwan, the fault line will also be considered in this part.

*Plane: Due to the global warming and overdeveloping, we think people should be more aware of the geographical features of the location they are willing to dwell in. Users could know whether the location is built in a soil liquefaction zone and a flood zone by simply inputting the accurate address or coordinates to the system.
